Offensive Security: It is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.
Defensive security: It is the process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats; learn more in the digital forensics room.

Tasks of Defensive Security:
- User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against various attacks that target their systems.
- Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the types of systems and devices that we have to manage and protect properly.
- Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
- Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Without proper logging and monitoring of the network, it wonâ€™t be possible to detect malicious activities and intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to know.

Security Operations Center (SOC):
- Monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events.
